# Test plan:
# a) Build an array of 1000 student models using build_student_array(number_of_students::Int64; max_sid::Int64 = 10000)::Array{Student,1}
# b) Pick a random student index (test_index) and grab that student model from the array 
# c) Pass the student array and the values for sid and netid from the random student into the find_student_index function
# d) If the impl is correct, the index returned from your function should be the test_index

# a)
test_std_array = build_student_array(1000);

# b) rand_index = 576;
rand_index = 7
test_std = test_std_array[rand_index];

# c) pass values -
test_idx = find_student_index(test_std_array; sid = -1, netid = "abc123");

# d) Same?
test_idx == rand_index
