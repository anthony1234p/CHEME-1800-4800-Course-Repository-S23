# Test plan:
# a) Build an array of 1000 student models using build_student_array(number_of_students::Int64; max_sid::Int64 = 10000)::Array{Student,1}
# b) Pick a random student index (test_index) and grab that student model from the array 
# c) Pass the student array and the values for sid and netid from the random student into the find_student_index function
# d) If the impl is correct, the index returned from your function should be the test_index
